# Tome
Tome (Tab/Home) is a small page I put together simply because I couldn't find a new tab home screen that did exactly what I want. I put together Tome in roughly an afternoon. I ignored some best practices and didn't leave any comments. Tome reflects my ability to hack together a solution quickly, not my skill as a developer.
# Features
### Bookmark Boxes
Bookmark boxes contain links to most visited sites. They must be changed by editing the HTML

### HotKeys
Bookmarks have a hotkey associated with them. When the page is in focus and a relevant hotkey is pressed the bookmark is opened.

### Quotes (Not implemented)
On page load, a random quote is placed above bookmark boxes. These quotes are pulled from an array.
